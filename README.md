Data Cleaning for the Human Activity Recognition Project at Universit√° Degli Studi di Genoa

The original data consists of 10299 measurements of 561 variables,
wich correspond to accelerometer and gyroscope registries of 30 volunteers
performing 6 different activities.

After cleaning this initial data, a tidy data set ("tidy_data_set.txt")
is delivered.

## The tidy data set
The tidy data set contains only mean and standard deviation measurements,
wich are averaged for every volunteer and activity.
