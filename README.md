Data Cleaning for the Human Activity Recognition Project at Universit√° Degli Studi di Genoa

The original data consists of 10299 measurements of 561 variables,
wich correspond to accelerometer and gyroscope registries of 30 volunteers
performing 6 different activities.

After cleaning this initial data, a tidy data set ("tidy_data_set.txt")
is delivered.

## The tidy data set
The tidy data set contains only mean and standard deviation measurements,
wich are averaged for every volunteer and activity.

## The R script
The repository contains an R script (`run_analysis.R`). Use the script
following these instructions:

1. Download the `run_analysis.R` to the data directory
2. Start R
3. If not installed, install de data.table package with `install.packages("data.table")`
4. Go to the directory where the data is located with the `setwd()` command
5. Execute (In R), `source("run_analysis.R")`
6. Execute `run_analysis()`

What the script should do is to take the original data and process it to obtain
the tidy data set described above.
